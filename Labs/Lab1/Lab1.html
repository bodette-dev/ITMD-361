  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <h1>What to Know About Me</h1>
  <p>This is my fourth year at IIT, but my third year as an ITM major. I am currently specializing in data management & analytics.
  In my free time, I enjoy reading and listening to music. I used to play video games quite a bit, but haven't been able to find much time for it as of late.
  I have had some prior experience with web design, but never fully explored it before. I am excited to start learning!</p>
